            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ul>
                <li>Know your risk: Check if your home is located in a flood-prone area.</li>
                <li>Prepare an emergency kit: Include a first aid kit, non-perishable food, and water for at least three days.</li>
                <li>Have an evacuation plan: Know the routes to higher ground and have a plan for your pets as well.</li>
                <li>Turn off electricity and gas: This will prevent electrocution and fire hazards.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ul>
                <li>Keep important documents safe: Store important documents in a waterproof container or upload them to a cloud service.</li>
                <li>Stay informed: Monitor news and weather reports for updates and warnings.</li>
                <li>Don't drive through floodwaters: It only takes six inches of water to cause a car to lose control and potentially stall.</li>
                <li>Seek higher ground: If you're caught in a flash flood, seek higher ground immediately and avoid walking through moving water.</li>
              </ul>

          <h2>What to Do After a Flood</h2>
          <p>After a flood, it's important to stay safe and start the recovery process as soon as possible. Here are some tips:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stay away from floodwaters: Even after the water recedes, it may be contaminated with hazardous materials.</li>
            <li>Check for damage: Inspect your home for damage and document it with photographs or video.</li>
            <li>Contact your insurance company: Report any damage to your insurance company and keep records of your communication.</li>
            <li>Start the cleanup process: Begin by removing any standing water and then clean and disinfect all surfaces that came into contact with floodwaters.</li>
          </ul>
